/*
 *	A CFBamAuthorization is an authorization ticket
 *	for the system providing services.  For example, a
 *	database layer implements an Authorization that
 *	resolves a database connection (which may be under the
 *	control of an active cursor).
 *
 *	The server uses the X509 payload to determine permissions
 *	granted to the user by querying a security server (LDAP
 *	based.)  .Net servers instantiate a new instance for
 *	each request, so there is no global memory available to
 *	store a cache of the active sessions keyed by UUID.
 *
 *	Use X509Cert.SubjectName for reporting the user name
 *	in exceptions and logs.
